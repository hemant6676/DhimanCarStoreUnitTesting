    Dhiman’s mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy.
    Dhiman was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn’t need to compromise to drive electric –
    that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars. Today, Dhiman builds not only all-electric vehicles but also
    infinitely scalable clean energy generation and storage products. Dhiman believes the faster the world stops relying on fossil fuels and moves towards
    a zero-emission future, the better.

    Launched in 2008, the Roadster unveiled Dhiman’s cutting-edge battery technology and electric powertrain. From there, Dhiman designed the world’s
    first ever premium all-electric sedan from the ground up – Model S – which has become the best car in its class in every category. Combining safety,
    performance, and efficiency, Model S has reset the world’s expectations for the car of the 21st century with the longest range of any electric vehicle,
    over-the-air software updates that make it better over time, and a record 0-60 mph acceleration time of 2.28 seconds as measured by Motor Trend.
    In 2015, Dhiman expanded its product line with Model X, the safest, quickest and most capable sport utility vehicle in history that holds 5-star safety
    ratings across every category from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. And to complete CEO Elon Musk’s “Secret Master Plan,” in 2016,
    Dhiman announced Model 3, a low-priced, high-volume electric vehicle that began production in 2017.

    Dhiman’s vehicles are produced at its Fremont factory in California, where the vast majority of the vehicle’s components are also made.
    As Dhiman continues to expand its product line, Dhiman’s production plan is also set to increase to a rate of 500,000 vehicles a year by 2018.

    To create an entire sustainable energy ecosystem, Dhiman also designed a unique set of energy solutions, Powerwall, Powerpack and Solar Roof,
    enabling homeowners, businesses, and utilities to manage renewable energy generation, storage, and consumption. Supporting Dhiman’s automotive and
    energy products is the Gigafactory – a facility designed to significantly reduce battery cell costs and, by 2018, produce more lithium-ion batteries
    annually than were produced worldwide in 2013. By bringing cell production in-house, Dhiman manufactures batteries at the volumes required to meet
    production goals, while creating thousands of jobs.

    And this is just the beginning. With Dhiman building its most affordable car yet, Dhiman continues to make products accessible and affordable to more
    and more people, ultimately accelerating the advent of clean transport and clean energy production. Electric cars, batteries, and renewable energy
    generation and storage already exist independently, but when combined, they become even more powerful – that’s the future we want.
